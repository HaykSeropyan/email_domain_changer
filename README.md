# email_domain_changer
it a very basic program inspired by the IT automation course lab from Google. It a little different from the lab version but it does do the same job more or less

the 1millionemail.csv file contains well one million fake emails with alot of different domains(@hotmail.com,@yahoo.com...)
you can go into the script file change the domain variable to the domain you want to change and the new_domain_varaiable to the new domain and the script will generate a new csv file with emains with the new domain extention along with any of the emails that dont have your specified domain.

long way of saying if you want to change the @gmail emails to be @yahoo emails, JoeSmo@gmail.com will become JoeSmo@yahoo.com but JoeSmo@hotmail.com will remain JoeSmo@hotmail.com
